<h3>Simple Spectra Correction</h3>

<p> Raman Spectra sometimes are seriously affected by flouresence noise, which is shown as a big bump. In this case, you can use the tool called baseline correction in the process panel. Another scenerio is when the spectra fluctates from an unstedy signal, causing significant peaks get hard to be recognized. Also for further statistic analysis, this fluctution can cause mis-classification. The tool user can select is called "smooth", which is also in the process panel. Furthermore, if you want to compare two spectra for the difference, the function "subtract" can be used to visualize the difference effectively. There are more tools can be used in the process panel to analyze your result. Just click "help" and type in the name of your interested tool, more detailed instructions can be found to assist you.</p>
