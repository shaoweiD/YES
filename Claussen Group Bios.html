    <h3>Eric Mootz</h3>
    <p>Eric is fortunate enough to call the wonderful lakeside city of Neenah, Wisconsin, home; however, his father’s career goals gave him and his family the opportunity to live in places such as Oklahoma, Georgia, and Kentucky. Luckily, he refrained from developing a southern accent. In May of 2015 he will be graduating with a Mechanical Engineering degree from Iowa State University. His academic interests are very broad, but he enjoys topics that deal with energy systems and manufacturing. He remains active through his participation in professional organizations including the ASHRAE Student Chapter and ASME as well as competing for Iowa State's Club Golf Team. Outside of these activities you’ll find Eric maintaining his health at the gym, obliterating ‘peasants’ on his custom gaming PC, or simply enjoying the weekend with his friends. </p>
